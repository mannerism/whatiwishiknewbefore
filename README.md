# what I wish I knew before
1. Planning is way harder than coding
2. Scalability in UI/UX is overrated and often times unnecessary. 
3. Any marketing within the company should be directed outside the company rather than inside the company.
4. The capacity of a CEO is the capacity of the company, unless the CEO is unusually open-minded. 
5. Be wary of working close by an intellecutally challenged person whose actions are bold and doesn't realize his or her limitations.
6. Don't try to understand every word spoken by a person whose voice is unbearably low. 
7. Conservatism stems out of 'safety-first' approach.
8. Me being wrong or right isn't as important as a company being successful, in fact, being completely wrong gives way more insights than being indecisive.
