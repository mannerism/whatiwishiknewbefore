# what I wish I knew before
1. Planning is way harder than coding
2. Scalability in UI/UX is overrated and often times unnecessary. 
3. Any marketing within the company should be directed towards outside the company rather than inside the company.
4. The capacity of a CEO is the capacity of the company, unless the CEO is unusually open-minded.
